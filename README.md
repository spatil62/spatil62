✨ About Me

I’m a problem-solving machine who turns everything into scalable, high-performance software.
With 3+ years of experience, I thrive on:
✔ Building robust systems that handle millions of users.
✔ Optimizing performance—because slow code is my nemesis. 🐢⚡
✔ Debugging the impossible—no bug survives my wrath. 🐛🔫


🔥 Why Work With Me?

✔ Relentless Debugger – I won’t stop until it’s fixed.
✔ Performance Obsessed – If it’s slow, I’ll optimize it.
✔ Clean Code Advocate – Maintainability matters.
✔ Cloud-Native Mindset – Scalability from day one.
